## How it works?

The 4 bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) has 2 inputs of 4 bits for each operand, 1 input of 3 bits to select the operational mode, 1 output of 8 bits with the result of the selected operation and 2 outputs of 1 bit each to identify an overflow or zero.

#How to test?

To test the design, the operation codes are: 

- Addition (000)
- Substraction (001)
- Multiplication (010) 
- Division (011) 
- Logic AND (100) 
- Logic OR (101) 
- Logic NOT (110) 
- Logic XOR (111)
